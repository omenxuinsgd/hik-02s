# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate any reports that help us improve Open Self Service.
If you discover a vulnerability, please **do not create a public issue**. Instead, report it privately by emailing us at:

**[security@openselfservice.com](mailto:security@openselfservice.com?subject=Security%20Issue%20Report)**

When reporting a security issue, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or additional useful information.

We will handle your report and the issue as soon as possible.

## Supported Versions

At this stage of development, we recommend always using the latest version of Open Self Service to ensure you have the most up-to-date security patches.
